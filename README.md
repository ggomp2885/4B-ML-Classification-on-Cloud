# 4B-ML-Classification-on-Cloud
Group repository for our FourthBrain week 5 assignment, "ML Classification on Cloud"

Some inital thoughts:

It looks like we can "plug and play" the CIFAR 100 dataset into either of the two computer vision Github repos linked at the top of the assignment
CIFAR 100 is a "toy" dataset that is already loaded into Keras, so we should be able to load this in, in one line.
